# Plot that data- with point labels! 
```{r plot}
p <- ggplot(data = monster_movies, aes(x = average_rating, y = num_votes, text =      paste("primary_title:", primary_title))) + #this is how you can make point text
     geom_point(alpha = (1/3)) + scale_x_log10() + #scale points and decrease alpha
  labs(title = "What Monster-ish movies are truly popular?",
       x = "Average Rating",
       y = "Number of Votes")

ggplotly(p)

```

I have learned that MonsterÊ»s Inc. is truly the most popular of the Monster-inclusive Movies, because it has the highest rating with the most votes by far. I am not surprised. 

However, I am more interested in movies that got a lot of bad ratings, because I like Bad Movies. Robot Monster (3.0 rating, 5538 votes), Monsters in the Woods (2.6 rating, 1497 votes), and Bottle Monster (2.5 rating at 932 votes) are where my heart lies. 


# What I learned 
I have never used the Plotly package! Being able to zoom into figures and see text above a point is a game changer. I love this thing and I am glad I tried it out.
